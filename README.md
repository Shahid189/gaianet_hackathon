Roman: Gaianet x Story Protocol x CDP Telegram Travel Chatbot

# README for Roman Telegram Chatbot

## In-Depth Overview

Roman is an avant-garde Telegram chatbot designed to revolutionize the way travelers and locals engage with local experiences. This chatbot is deployed on AWS Lambda, ensuring robust scalability and reliability. Roman is intricately connected to a Crew AI agent that leverages the power of Gaia Net nodes, creating a seamless integration of advanced technologies. The bot utilizes a dataset registered as an NFT/IP in the Story Protocol, a pioneering approach that ensures data authenticity and ownership. This dataset is a rich repository of local experiences, offering users unparalleled insights into authentic local culture and attractions. When a user poses a question, Roman efficiently sends a request to an ngrok URL where the Crew AI is deployed. The Crew AI processes this request, interacts with the Content Delivery Network (CDN), and sends a token to the original IP owner, thereby incentivizing local contributors to share more about their unique experiences.

The bot is actively operational on Telegram under the handle - @gaia_hackathon_story_bot, providing users with a direct line to explore and discover local gems.
